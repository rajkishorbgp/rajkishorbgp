## ðŸ“– About Me

Hello, I'm Raj Kishor, an experienced Android Developer based in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India. My journey in the world of app development has been enriched with a robust command of Java, C, C++, Python, and Kotlin.

In my six months as a Freelance Android Developer, I've dedicated myself to creating user-friendly, high-performance apps, specializing in AI/ML and Networking. I've actively contributed to open-source projects on GitHub, staying updated with the latest industry trends.

During my tenure at Topperworld, I played a crucial role in developing versatile applications, including a Unit Converter, To-Do, and Quiz application. This hands-on experience sharpened my skills in data analysis, project management, and Android app development.

My commitment to excellence is further highlighted by my internship at Bharat Intern, where I successfully completed projects like a Calculator App, Temperature Converter App, and Quiz App. I've also undergone Android Developer Training with Acmegrade, contributing to the development of a robust e-commerce Android application.

As a certified Java Developer with DSA expertise from Apna College, I've acquired a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. Currently pursuing a BCA in Computer Science from CCS University, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to exciting projects.

I'm enthusiastic about driving innovation, delivering exceptional user experiences, and continually learning. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects!
